This is a sample markdown file with tables. The table contents should not be
wrapped, and each line should retain its original formatting.

## Table Example

Here's an example of a table in markdown:

| Column 1 Heading                               | Column 2 Heading                                     | Column 3 Heading                                         |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| This is a long text that exceeds 80 characters | This is another long text that exceeds 80 characters | This is yet another long text that exceeds 80 characters |
| Short text                                     | Short text                                           | Short text                                               |

The table above should not be wrapped, and each line, including the long text in
the table cells, should maintain its original formatting.

## Another Table Example

Here's another table example:

| Header 1                                                           | Header 2   | Header 3                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A very long text that should not be wrapped within the table cell. | Short text | Another long text that exceeds 80 characters and should not be wrapped within the table cell.     |
| Short text                                                         | Long text  | Yet another long text that exceeds 80 characters and should not be wrapped within the table cell. |

Again, the table should not be wrapped, and each line, including the long texts
in the table cells, should maintain their original formatting.
